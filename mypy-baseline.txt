# Mypy baseline (generated to allow incremental typing)
# Format: one file path per line, or 'pattern:count' in future extensions.
# For now, we use simple presence gating: if mypy finds errors and this file exists,
# CI will compare total errors and only fail if new errors are added (script in workflow).
