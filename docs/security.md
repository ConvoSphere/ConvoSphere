# Security Documentation

## üîí Security Overview

The AI Chat Application implements comprehensive security measures to protect user data and ensure system integrity.

### Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for all components
- **Secure by Default**: Secure configurations out of the box
- **Regular Updates**: Security patches and dependency updates

## üõ°Ô∏è Technical Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Refresh Tokens**: Automatic token renewal
- **Role-Based Access Control**: 4 user levels (Standard, Premium, Moderator, Admin)
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with Redis

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: Database encryption for sensitive data
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt for password storage
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization

### Network Security

- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted cross-origin requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **WebSocket Security**: Secure WebSocket connections

### Application Security

- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery prevention
- **File Upload Security**: Strict file type and size validation

## üîß Administrator Recommendations

### Deployment Security

1. **Use HTTPS in Production**
   ```bash
   # Configure SSL certificates
   # Use reverse proxy (nginx/traefik)
   # Enable HSTS headers
   ```

2. **Secure Database Access**
   ```bash
   # Use strong database passwords
   # Restrict database network access
   # Enable database encryption
   # Regular database backups
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Store secrets in environment variables
   # Never commit secrets to version control
   # Use .env files for local development
   # Use secret management in production
   ```

### Monitoring & Logging

1. **Enable Security Logging**
   ```bash
   # Log authentication attempts
   # Log file uploads and downloads
   # Log admin actions
   # Monitor for suspicious activity
   ```

2. **Regular Security Audits**
   ```bash
   # Dependency vulnerability scans
   # Code security reviews
   # Penetration testing
   # Security configuration reviews
   ```

### Access Control

1. **User Management**
   - Implement strong password policies
   - Enable two-factor authentication (if available)
   - Regular user access reviews
   - Immediate deactivation of inactive accounts

2. **Admin Access**
   - Limit admin accounts to essential personnel
   - Use separate admin accounts (not shared)
   - Regular admin access reviews
   - Log all admin actions

### Backup & Recovery

1. **Regular Backups**
   ```bash
   # Database backups (daily)
   # File storage backups (daily)
   # Configuration backups (weekly)
   # Test backup restoration regularly
   ```

2. **Disaster Recovery**
   - Document recovery procedures
   - Test recovery processes
   - Maintain backup copies off-site
   - Regular disaster recovery drills

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Assess scope and impact
   - Notify relevant stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Document incident details
   - Identify root cause
   - Assess data compromise
   - Implement containment measures

3. **Recovery**
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Update security measures
   - Monitor for recurrence
