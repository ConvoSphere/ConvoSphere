## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

#### MessageReaction Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE message_reactions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    emoji VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    message_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES messages(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Enhanced Conversation Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE conversations ADD COLUMN archived_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE conversations RENAME COLUMN conversation_metadata TO metadata;
```

#### Enhanced Message Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE messages RENAME COLUMN message_metadata TO metadata;
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN reactions JSONB DEFAULT '[]';
```

### Service Layer

#### ConversationService Enhancements
- `search_messages()`: Full-text search with filters
- `export_conversation()`: Multi-format export
- `get_conversation_context()`: Context retrieval
- `update_conversation_context()`: Context updates
- `add_message_reaction()`: Reaction management
- `remove_message_reaction()`: Reaction removal
- `switch_assistant()`: Assistant switching
- `delete_message()`: Message deletion

### Security Considerations

#### Access Control
- Users can only access their own conversations
- Message deletion limited to user's own messages
- Reaction management limited to user's own reactions
- Export access verified against conversation ownership

#### Rate Limiting
- Message search: 100 requests per minute
- Export: 10 requests per minute
- Reactions: 200 requests per minute
- Context updates: 50 requests per minute

#### Data Privacy
- Export files expire after 24 hours
- Deleted messages are permanently removed
- Context data is user-specific and encrypted

## Performance Optimizations

### Search Optimization
- Database indexes on message content and metadata
- Full-text search capabilities
- Pagination for large result sets
- Caching of frequent search results

### Export Optimization
- Asynchronous export processing for large conversations
- File compression for download optimization
- Background cleanup of expired export files
- Streaming for large file downloads

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket connections for instant updates
- Efficient message broadcasting
- Connection pooling and management
- Graceful disconnection handling

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Advanced Search:** Semantic search using embeddings
2. **Export Templates:** Customizable export formats
3. **Reaction Analytics:** Usage statistics and insights
4. **Context Sharing:** Share context between conversations
5. **Assistant Chaining:** Automatic assistant switching based on content

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Knowledge Base:** Link conversations to knowledge articles
2. **Analytics Dashboard:** Conversation insights and metrics
3. **Collaboration Tools:** Multi-user conversation features
4. **API Integrations:** Third-party tool connections
5. **Mobile Support:** Enhanced mobile chat experience

## Troubleshooting
