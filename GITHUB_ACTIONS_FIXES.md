# GitHub Actions Issues and Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. GitHub Script Permission Error (403 - Resource not accessible by integration)

**Problem**: The `actions/github-script@v6` action was failing with a 403 error when trying to create comments on pull requests.

**Root Cause**: Missing permissions configuration in the workflow files.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `permissions` block to both workflow files:
  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: read
    issues: write
    pull-requests: write
  ```

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/test-pipeline.yml`
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

### 2. Ruff Format Command Syntax Error

**Problem**: The `ruff format --check` command was using incorrect syntax with `--output-format=json`.

**Root Cause**: The `ruff format` command doesn't support the `--output-format` flag in the same way as `ruff check`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed from:
  ```bash
  ruff format --check backend/ --output-format=json > ruff-format-report.json
  ```
- To:
  ```bash
  ruff format --check backend/ > ruff-format-report.json
  ```

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

### 3. Deprecated Action Version

**Problem**: Using `actions/download-artifact@v3` which is deprecated.

**Root Cause**: GitHub deprecated v3 of the download-artifact action.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated to `actions/download-artifact@v4`

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/test-pipeline.yml`

### 4. Improved Error Handling

**Problem**: GitHub script actions could fail the entire workflow if commenting failed.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added try-catch blocks around GitHub API calls
- Added graceful error handling that logs errors but doesn't fail the workflow
- Added `await` keywords for proper async handling

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/test-pipeline.yml`
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Repository Settings

Ensure your repository has the following settings configured:

1. **Actions permissions**: Go to Settings → Actions → General
   - Ensure "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" is enabled
   - Set "Workflow permissions" to "Read and write permissions"

2. **Branch protection**: If you have branch protection rules, ensure they allow GitHub Actions to push to protected branches if needed.

### 2. Token Permissions

The workflows now use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` with explicit permissions. If you need additional permissions, you can:

1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the required scopes
2. Add it as a repository secret
3. Use it in the workflow instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN`

### 3. Monitoring

To monitor if these fixes work:

1. Check the Actions tab in your repository
2. Look for successful runs without permission errors
3. Verify that comments are being posted to pull requests
4. Check that linting reports are generated correctly

### 4. Future Maintenance

- Regularly update GitHub Actions to their latest versions
- Monitor GitHub's deprecation notices
- Test workflows after major updates
- Consider using Dependabot to automatically update GitHub Actions

## Testing the Fixes

To test these fixes:

1. **Create a test pull request** with a small change
2. **Monitor the workflow runs** in the Actions tab
3. **Check for comments** on the pull request
4. **Verify no permission errors** in the logs

The workflows should now:
- ✅ Successfully post comments to pull requests
- ✅ Run ruff linting without syntax errors
- ✅ Use up-to-date action versions
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully without failing the entire workflow
